		<p>Brian likes to run, jog, and jump. He's been doing it his whole life. There's no telling when he might stop. For now, he's working on coding. He's hoping to learn a lot about coding in order to make a career change.</p>
	
		<p>Brian's favorite foods are tacos, ice cream, and Sour Patch Kids. His favorite sport is basketball. Brian has trouble sleeping from time to time, which sucks. But he'll figure it out!</p>
